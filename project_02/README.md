ENGI 301 Project 2: Etch-a-sketch
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a PCB design for an etch-a-sketch drawing device. This design is based on a PocketBeagle microcomputer and uses an SPI Display Screen, two potentiometers, two  buttons, three LEDs (red, green, and blue), and a USB expansion port. Please see the "etch_a_sketch_schematic.brd" for the EAGLE board design, "ENGI301_project_02.pptx" for the mechanical drawing, and "combo_lock2" for the library file.
